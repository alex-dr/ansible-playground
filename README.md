# Ansible Playground

This repository is for one-off Ansible playbooks for the purpose of testing out
and recording interesting tidbits of its mechanics, best practices, etc.

Currently there is no prescription for how exactly to structure this, but try
to keep tests separate. Feel free to make your own subdirectories with their
own roles/playbooks/handlers/group vars/inventories or add to existing ones, so
long as you don't break existing tests.
